===============================

The application needs to be served of a webserver, such as Node.js http-server for localhost, or off an internet server.

The only input that the game recognizes is arrow keys, which move the player. You win (and the level advances) every time your player successfully reaches the water. Higher levels mean more and faster-moving enemies. Watch out! If one of the bugs touches you, you lose and go back to level 1.
